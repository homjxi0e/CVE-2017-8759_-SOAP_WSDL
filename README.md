# What is CVE-2017-8759
is  Remote Code Execution Vulnerability On SOAP WDSL
A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework processes untrusted input. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability in software using the .NET framework could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first need to convince the user to open a malicious document or application.
The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET validates untrusted input
